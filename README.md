## Public Car Rental

This is the main document for the project containing different sections about specifications, technologies, configuration etc. In later stages a repository or a wiki can be used for documentation.

### Public Car Rental Specifications

The system should enable registered users to rent public car in streets based on their preferences. While booking a car a user can define model, year, fuel type, infotainment system etc. of the desired car. Furthermore, the system should respect the desired pick-up and drop-off locations as well as the earliest pick-up and drop-off times. 

While providing a car for a user the system should choose the most beneficial trip for a specific car. For example, user X wants to rent a car from A to B costing 20 euro between 14:00 and 16:00. User Y wants to rent the same car from A to C costing 10 euro between 14:00 and 15:00. Lastly, user Z  will rent the car from C to D between 15:00 and 16:30, which costs 15 euro. Then the system should recommend this car to user Y not X, since two users Y and Z will provide more income to system than X alone.

System should provide a dashboard showing available cars with their actual locations and attributes. Furthermore, on a map view locations and travelled distances of cars should be shown to the users.
